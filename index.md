## UW NLP Capstone

### Blog Post \#1

Our team, BallmerNLP, is comprised of Nelson Liu, Mathew Luo, and Deric Pang.
Our capstone will be hosted at
[https://github.com/dericp/uw-nlp-capstone](https://github.com/dericp/uw-nlp-capstone).

There are three potential projects we are excited about:
  * Alternative ELMo objective of predicting the next n words
  * Creating a new Penn Treebank test set to evaluate whether parsers are
    overfit
  * Using human attention to bias models

#### Alternative ELMO Objective

Blah blah blah.

#### Are Parsers Overfit to PTB?

Blah blah blah.

#### Biasing models with Human Attention

Blah blah blah.
