## UW NLP Capstone

### Blog Post \#1

Our team, BallmerNLP, is comprised of Nelson Liu, Mathew Luo, and Deric Pang.
Our capstone will be hosted at
[https://github.com/dericp/uw-nlp-capstone](https://github.com/dericp/uw-nlp-capstone).

There are three potential projects we are excited about.

#### Alternative ELMO Objective

Blah blah blah.

#### Are Parsers Overfit to PTB?

Blah blah blah.

#### Biasing models with Human Attention

For this task, we would start with obtaining datasets with annotated human
attention. We then develop models that can read in human attention and use them
as parameters, mostly by modifying existing models that do not use human attention.
After we trained these models that use human attention, they can be compared
on the same datasets against the models that do not use human attention. We
can then analyze how using human attention can affect existing models.
